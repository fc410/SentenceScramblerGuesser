# Overview:
For this project I want to grab a sentence from the server and randomize the letters and persent the scrambled sentece so they can guess the sentence. If the user gets a correct letter the textbox will turn green and proceed to the next letter. If the user gets the sentence correct the can proceed to the next sentence and so on.
