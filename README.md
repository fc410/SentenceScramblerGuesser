# Overview:
For this project I want to grab a sentence from the server and randomize the letters and persent the scrambled sentece to the user so they can guess the sentence. If the user gets a correct letter the textbox will turn green and proceed to the next textbox. If the user gets the sentence correct the can proceed to the next sentence and so on. Once the user guessed 10 sentences correctly I wand to display a message saying they won.
